# Sales analysis (Excel)

## Project Overview
- An electronics store needs to increase its profits
- A KPI is found that will allow to increase profits at the lowest cost.
- Sales were evaluated by product, city, and month
- This analysis was done on a database with 180,000+ values using Excel only 
(My laptop was not happy about this :P)

## Objetives:
### Questions that will drive the analysis
- Which product of all the stores generates the highest profits?
- Which months of 2019 will generate the highest profits and on which dates?
- What are the best months to sell our products?

## Cleaning and preparation:
The data shows the sales of an electronics store, you can see the raw data in this 
As you can see in the image below, the format of the data was not appropriate for the analysis, so it had to be cleaned and prepared.
